question: What is the main flaw of the ECB method with a block cipher?
answer: It is deterministic and can reveal patterns in the data
wrong_answers:
  - It requires keys of variable length
  - It does not work with messages over 128 bits
  - It does not work with messages over 256 bits
explanation: |
  The ECB method ("Electronic Code Book") is deterministic: identical blocks of data are encrypted in the same way, which allows patterns to be detected in the encrypted text.
