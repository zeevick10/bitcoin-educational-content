question: What role does the byte substitution operation (S-Box) play in AES encryption?
answer: It introduces confusion by substituting each byte with another
wrong_answers:
  - It ensures integrity by checking the message bytes
  - It shuffles the columns to increase diffusion
  - It divides the plaintext into 128-bit blocks
explanation: |
  The byte substitution operation (S-Box) in AES introduces confusion by replacing each byte with a different value according to a table, making the encrypted text more difficult to analyze.
