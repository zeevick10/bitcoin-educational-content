question: What is the purpose of the "shift rows" operation in AES?
answer: To increase diffusion by rearranging the bytes in the state table
wrong_answers:
  - Ensure that each block is the same length
  - Apply a secret key to each row of the state table
  - Introduce additional confusion by substituting bytes
explanation: |
  The "shift rows" operation in AES rearranges the bytes in the state table to spread out the information, thereby increasing diffusion.
