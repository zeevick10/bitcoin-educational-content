question: What does the notation "/<0;1>/*" in a descriptor correspond to?
answer: To the external and internal chain with sequential derivation
wrong_answers:
  - To a sorted multisignature address
  - To a checksum for derivation paths
  - To a hardened derivation path
explanation: |
  The notation "/<0;1>/*" indicates that the descriptor can generate addresses for the external (0) and internal (1) chain, with sequential derivation thanks to the wildcard (*).
